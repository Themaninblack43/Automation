### Testing Tips

**For Invoice OCR:**
- Key fields to extract: Invoice #, Amount, Date, Vendor, Due Date
- Amount should include dollar sign: $5,420.88
- Test both decimal formats: $5,420.88 and $5420.88

**For Receipt OCR:**
- May need to extract from different locations
- Total is usually at bottom
- Date formats vary: 10/21/2025 vs Oct 21, 2025
- Vendor name might be logo (harder to extract)

**Common OCR Challenges:**
- Dollar signs and commas in amounts
- Multiple dates on same receipt (transaction date vs due date)
- Distinguishing subtotal from total
- Vendor name formatting (ALL CAPS, title case, etc.)
