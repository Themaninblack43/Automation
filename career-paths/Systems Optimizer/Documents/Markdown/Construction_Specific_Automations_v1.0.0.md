## AUTOMATION #11: Job Cost Overrun Alerts

**The Problem:**  
In construction, you often don't realize a project is losing money until it's too late.

**The Solution:**
```
Trigger: Project expenses reach 85% of budget
        (At any point during project)

Action 1: Calculate projected final cost
         ├─ Current: 72% complete, 85% of budget used
         └─ Projection: Will be 18% over budget at completion

Action 2: Alert project manager immediately
         ├─ Email + SMS
         └─ "URGENT: Johnson project tracking over budget"

Action 3: Generate variance report
         ├─ Which cost categories are over?
         ├─ Labor hours vs. estimate
         └─ Materials costs vs. estimate

Action 4: Create task for project manager
         └─ "Review Johnson project costs - appears to be over budget"

Action 5: Notify owner if variance over $X
         └─ Threshold: $5,000 or 10% overrun
```

**Value:** Catch problems while you can still do something about them

## AUTOMATION #12: Retention Tracking & Release

**The Problem:**  
Tracking retention held for multiple subs across multiple projects is complex. Easy to forget to release retention, damaging relationships.

**The Solution:**
```
Trigger: Project status changed to "Complete"

Action 1: Calculate all retention held for this project
         ├─ Electrician: $2,400
         ├─ Plumber: $1,850
         ├─ Drywaller: $3,200
         └─ Total: $7,450

Action 2: Send lien waiver requests
         └─ Auto-email final lien waiver form to each sub

Action 3: Track lien waiver receipt
         ├─ Electrician: ✓ Received
         ├─ Plumber: ⏱ Pending
         └─ Drywaller: ✓ Received

Action 4: When all waivers received:
         └─ Auto-generate retention release payment batch

Action 5: Process payments
         └─ Release all retention automatically

Action 6: Update records
         ├─ Mark retention as released
         └─ Update subcontractor payment history

Action 7: Send thank you emails
         └─ "Final payment sent - thanks for great work on Johnson project"
```

**Value:** Never forget retention, maintain good sub relationships, reduce legal risk

## AUTOMATION #13: Insurance Certificate Tracking

**The Problem:**  
Subcontractors' insurance expires. If they work without current insurance, you're liable.

**The Solution:**
```
Trigger: Subcontractor insurance expiring in 30 days
        (Daily automated check)

Action 1: Send reminder email to subcontractor
         └─ "Your insurance expires November 20 - please provide updated certificate"

Action 2: Set follow-up reminders
         ├─ 20 days before expiration
         ├─ 10 days before expiration
         └─ 5 days before expiration

Action 3: If expires without update:
         ├─ Flag subcontractor as "Not approved"
         ├─ Block them from being assigned to new work
         ├─ Hold any pending payments
         └─ Alert all project managers

Action 4: When new certificate received:
         ├─ Verify coverage amounts meet requirements
         ├─ Update database with new expiration date
         ├─ Remove "Not approved" flag
         └─ Release any held payments

Action 5: Maintain historical record
         └─ Track all certificates for compliance/audit
```

**Value:** Avoid massive liability, stay compliant, protect business

## AUTOMATION #14: Lien Waiver Management

**The Problem:**  
You must collect lien waivers before/after each payment to protect against mechanic's liens. Easy to forget, huge legal risk if you don't.

**The Solution:**
```
Trigger: Subcontractor payment processed

Action 1: Auto-generate appropriate lien waiver
         ├─ Conditional waiver (for progress payments)
         └─ Or unconditional waiver (for final payments)

Action 2: Email to subcontractor for signature
         ├─ Electronic signature via DocuSign/HelloSign
         └─ "Please sign waiver for payment of $7,650"

Action 3: Track receipt
         └─ Status: "Sent, awaiting signature"

Action 4: Send reminders if not returned
         ├─ After 3 days: Reminder
         └─ After 7 days: Hold next payment until received

Action 5: When signed waiver received:
         ├─ Save to "Lien Waivers/Johnson Project/" folder
         ├─ Link to payment record
         └─ Mark as received in tracking database

Action 6: At project completion:
         └─ Verify all lien waivers collected
         └─ Flag any missing waivers before final closeout

Action 7: Maintain organized archive
         └─ Critical for legal defense if lien claim filed
```

**Value:** Protect against liens (could save $50K-500K+ in legal costs)

## AUTOMATION #15: Change Order Processing

**The Problem:**  
Client requests change to project. Change orders affect budget, schedule, billing. Must be tracked accurately.

**The Solution:**
```
Trigger: Change order form submitted
        (Project manager creates change order)

Action 1: Calculate impact
         ├─ Additional cost: $4,200
         ├─ Additional time: 3 days
         └─ New contract total: $284,200 (was $280,000)

Action 2: Generate change order document
         └─ Professional format with all details

Action 3: Send to client for approval
         ├─ Email with e-signature link
         └─ "Please approve change order #14-A"

Action 4: When client approves:
         ├─ Update contract value in all systems
         ├─ Update project budget
         ├─ Update project schedule
         └─ Notify all stakeholders

Action 5: Update billing
         └─ Next progress billing includes change order amount

Action 6: Update accounting
         ├─ QuickBooks shows new contract value
         └─ Project profitability calculations updated

Action 7: Document trail
         └─ Maintain complete change order history per project
```

**Value:** Ensure you get paid for extra work, maintain accurate budgets, clear client communication
