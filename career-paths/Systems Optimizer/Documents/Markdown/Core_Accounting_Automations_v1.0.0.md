# Core Accounting Automations
## 10 Essential Automations: 1970s Manual Process vs 2025 Automation

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Created:** October 21, 2025  
**Purpose:** Examples to explain automation value to anyone who's done manual accounting

## What is Zapier?

**Zapier is software that connects your business apps and automates workflows.**

**Simple explanation:**  
"When THIS happens, automatically do THAT."

**Examples:**
- When an invoice arrives by email → Save it, log it, and set a payment reminder
- When an expense is submitted → Categorize it, route it for approval, and update budgets
- When a payment is received → Mark the invoice paid, update cash flow, and thank the customer

**The pattern:** Trigger → Action → Action → Action...

Every automation follows this same simple logic, but the combinations are endless.

## The 10 Core Accounting Automations

---

### AUTOMATION #1: Invoice & Receipt Tracking

#### **The 1970s Way (Manual Process)**

**Daily routine:**
1. Mail arrives with invoices from suppliers
2. Open each envelope
3. Date stamp the invoice
4. Manually write invoice details in ledger:
   - Date
   - Vendor name
   - Invoice number
   - Amount
   - Due date
   - Account code
5. File physical copy in vendor folder
6. Calculate running total by hand
7. At month end: Type monthly summary report
8. Pray nothing got lost or misfiled

**Time per invoice:** 5 minutes  
**Typical volume:** 20 invoices per week  
**Weekly time cost:** 100 minutes (1 hour 40 minutes)

#### **The 2025 Automated Way**

**ZAP SETUP:**
```
Trigger: Email received with attachment from known vendor
        (e.g., invoice@supplier.com)

Action 1: Save PDF attachment to Google Drive
         └─ File path: "Invoices/2025/October/[Vendor Name]/"
         
Action 2: Extract key data from PDF using OCR
         ├─ Invoice number
         ├─ Invoice date
         ├─ Amount due
         ├─ Due date
         └─ Vendor name
         
Action 3: Create new row in "Accounts Payable" spreadsheet
         └─ All extracted data auto-fills
         
Action 4: Create invoice in QuickBooks/Xero
         └─ Status: "Awaiting payment"
         
Action 5: Send Slack notification to AP team
         └─ "New invoice from [Vendor] - $X due [Date]"
         
Action 6: Create calendar reminder
         └─ 3 days before due date
```

**Time per invoice:** 2 seconds (automatic)  
**Human involvement:** Only review flagged exceptions  
**Weekly time cost:** 5 minutes (checking exceptions only)

**Time saved:** 95 minutes per week

---

### AUTOMATION #2: Expense Tracking by Project

#### **The 1970s Way (Manual Process)**

**When employee submits expense:**
1. Employee fills out paper expense report
2. Attaches physical receipts (stapled or taped)
3. Submits to accounting via mail or hand delivery
4. Accountant reviews each receipt
5. Manually allocates to correct job/project number
6. Types into project cost ledger
7. Types into general expense ledger
8. Calculates project totals by hand
9. Updates budget tracking spreadsheet
10. At month end: Generate project profitability reports
11. Re-key everything for tax purposes

**Special pain point for construction:**  
Job costing was CRITICAL. Every nail, every worker hour, every truck rental had to be allocated to the right project to know if you were making or losing money.

**Time per expense:** 10 minutes  
**Typical volume:** 30 expenses per week  
**Weekly time cost:** 300 minutes (5 hours)

#### **The 2025 Automated Way**

### AUTOMATION #9: Time Tracking to Billing (Construction Labor)

#### **The 1970s Way (Manual Process)**

**Weekly payroll & billing routine:**
1. **Collect timesheets** from all job sites (paper)
2. **For each employee, each day:**
   - Read handwriting (often illegible)
   - Verify hours make sense
   - Note which job site they worked
   - Calculate total hours worked
   - Calculate regular vs. overtime
3. **Calculate pay:**
   - Regular hours × hourly rate
   - OT hours × 1.5 rate
   - Add up for week
4. **Type into payroll ledger**
5. **Calculate payroll taxes** (by hand or calculator)
6. **Write paychecks**
7. **Now for billing:**
   - Calculate billable hours per project
   - Apply billing rate (often different from pay rate)
   - Note on project tracking sheet
   - Will be billed to client in next invoice
8. **Update project budgets:**
   - Hours used vs. hours budgeted
   - Often discover you're over budget too late

**Time per employee:** 10 minutes  
**Typical crew:** 20 employees  
**Weekly time cost:** 200 minutes = 3 hours 20 minutes  
**Annual time cost:** 173 hours per year

#### **The 2025 Automated Way**

**ZAP SETUP:**
```
Trigger: Employee clocks out
        (Via mobile time tracking app - GPS verified)

### AUTOMATION #10: Purchase Order Tracking

#### **The 1970s Way (Manual Process)**

**PO process:**
1. **Create purchase order:**
   - Fill out pre-printed form (carbon copies)
   - Keep one copy for your files
   - Mail one to vendor
   - Give one to receiving department
2. **File in "Open POs" folder**
3. **Wait for delivery:**
   - Receiving clerk marks goods received
   - Sends copy to accounting
4. **Wait for invoice:**
   - Could arrive before or after goods
5. **When invoice arrives:**
   - Find the PO in filing cabinet
   - Compare invoice to PO:
     - Do quantities match?
     - Do prices match?
     - Do part numbers match?
   - If matches: Approve for payment
   - If doesn't match: Call vendor, investigate
6. **Manual tracking:**
   - Hope you don't lose track of open POs
   - Month end: Dig through files to find what's still open

**Time per PO:** 10 minutes to create + 10 minutes to match invoice  
**Typical volume:** 15 POs per week  
**Weekly time cost:** 150 minutes (2.5 hours)

**Problems:**
- Lost POs
- Forgotten POs
- Can't quickly see what's outstanding
- Hard to track spending against budget

#### **The 2025 Automated Way**

**ZAP SETUP:**
```
Trigger: Purchase order created in system
        (Project manager creates PO online)

Action 1: Auto-generate PO number
         └─ Sequential: PO-2025-0847

Action 2: Email PO to vendor automatically
         ├─ Professional PDF format
         ├─ All terms and conditions included
         └─ Delivery confirmation requested

Action 3: Create row in "Open POs Tracker"
         ├─ PO number
         ├─ Vendor
         ├─ Amount
         ├─ Items ordered
         ├─ Expected delivery date
         ├─ Project/job number
         └─ Status: "Open"

Action 4: Add to project budget tracking
         ├─ Commit amount against project budget
         └─ Show as "Committed but not spent"

Action 5: Set reminder for expected delivery
         └─ If delivery date passes with no goods: Alert purchasing

When invoice arrives:

Action 6: Automatically match to PO
         ├─ Search for PO number in invoice
         ├─ Or match by vendor + amount
         └─ Link invoice to PO

Action 7: Compare amounts
         ├─ PO amount: $3,847.50
         ├─ Invoice amount: $3,847.50
         └─ Match: ✓ Proceed to payment

         If amounts don't match:
         ├─ Flag: "Invoice/PO mismatch"
         ├─ Alert purchasing manager
         ├─ Hold payment until resolved
         └─ Create task: "Verify [Vendor] invoice variance"

Action 8: When payment processed:
         ├─ Mark PO status: "Closed"
         ├─ Move to "Completed POs" database
         └─ Update project costs from "committed" to "actual"

Action 9: Dashboard views:
         ├─ Total open POs: $47,200
         ├─ POs pending delivery: 8
         ├─ POs delivered, pending invoice: 3
         └─ POs by project
```

**Time per PO:** 2 minutes (create) + 30 seconds (verify match)  
**Weekly time cost:** 35 minutes  
**Time saved:** 115 minutes per week (nearly 2 hours)

**Bonus benefits:**
- Never lose a PO
- Always know what's outstanding
- Catch price discrepancies immediately
- Better budget visibility (committed vs. spent)

| **Weekly Total** | **1,560 min** | **120 min** | **1,440 min** |

**Weekly time saved: 1,440 minutes = 24 hours**

### Monthly Time Saved

```
Weekly savings:           1,440 minutes × 4 weeks = 5,760 minutes
Monthly reporting:        960 minutes saved
AR progress billing:      290 minutes saved
Bank reconciliation:      210 minutes saved (4-6 hrs vs 15 min)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
MONTHLY TOTAL:            7,220 minutes = 120 hours

That's 3 FULL-TIME WEEKS of work
```

### Annual Time Saved

```
Monthly: 120 hours × 12 months = 1,440 hours per year

At $50/hour accounting cost = $72,000 per year saved
At $30/hour bookkeeper cost = $43,200 per year saved
```

### What This Means

**For a small business:**

**Option 1: Maintain current staffing, increase capacity**
- Same bookkeeper, now handles 3x the volume
- Can take on more projects without adding overhead
- Better, faster, more accurate reporting

**Option 2: Reduce staffing cost**
- Full-time bookkeeper → Part-time (20 hrs/week)
- Save $30,000-40,000 per year
- Still get better results than before

**Option 3: Redirect effort to strategic work**
- Less data entry = more time for:
  - Tax planning
  - Cash flow optimization
  - Financial analysis
  - Cost reduction opportunities
  - Better vendor negotiations
