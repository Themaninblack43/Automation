### Current State (Manual Processes)

**Accounting staff:**
- 1 full-time bookkeeper: $50,000/year
- Benefits & taxes (30%): $15,000/year

- Reconciliation: 20% (8 hours/week)
- Reporting: 15% (6 hours/week)
- Strategic work: 5% (2 hours/week)

**Problems:**
- Always behind (typically 2-3 weeks behind reality)
- Limited real-time visibility
- Errors occur (human nature)
- Can't take on more work without adding staff
- Owner doesn't have timely financial information
- Projects can be over budget before you know

### Future State (With Automation)

**Option A: Same Staff, Better Results**
- Keep same bookkeeper

- Reconciliation: 5% (2 hours/week) ← 75% reduction

- Strategic work: 80% (32 hours/week) ← 16x increase

**New capabilities:**
- Real-time financial visibility
- Project profitability tracking (live)
- Cash flow forecasting
- Better vendor negotiations (time for research)
- Tax planning and optimization
- Could handle 2-3x the project volume

**Option B: Reduce Cost**
- Part-time bookkeeper (20 hours/week): $30,000/year
- Save $35,000/year in direct costs
- Still get better, faster, more accurate accounting
- Reinvest savings in growth

**Option C: Hybrid**
- Keep full-time bookkeeper
- Add accounting clerk part-time: $20,000/year
- Now can handle 3-4x the volume
- Support aggressive growth without proportional overhead increase
